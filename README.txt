welcome to my .txt file
i only made this account just to help the twemoji devs on their stuff
i dont know how to code i just design with svgs 😕 (im still learning!!1!!1!1)
my favorite emojis are smileys such as 🫠,🫥, 🫨, 🙂‍↔, 🙂‍↕, etc.
base-12 (superior) > base-10 (old and shitty) 😤 01234567789↊↋
🫤 gotta be the most relatable emoji
help me
how come 😀 + 😁 doesn't exist
i know how to type actual fractions like 23⁄140 (oh shit this is a monospaced font 😓)
HELP!
I hope someone in the ESC proposes a shrugging smiley emoji (that'd be cool)
